# Employee Attrition Prediction – Salifort Motors

##  Project Overview

The Human Resources department at **Salifort Motors** aims to improve employee satisfaction and reduce employee turnover. Employee attrition is costly in terms of recruitment, training, and lost productivity. To address this issue, the company collected employee-related data to better understand the factors that influence an employee’s decision to leave.

This project applies **data analysis and machine learning techniques** to identify key drivers of employee attrition and to build a predictive model that can determine whether an employee is likely to leave the company. The insights gained from this analysis can help stakeholders take **proactive, data-driven actions** to improve employee retention.

##  Project Objectives

* Analyze employee data to understand patterns related to attrition
* Identify the most influential factors contributing to employee turnover
* Build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict employee attrition
* Provide actionable recommendations to improve employee satisfaction and retention

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains employee-level information collected by the HR department. It includes variables related to workload, performance, tenure, promotions, compensation, and job satisfaction.

### Key Features:

* Number of projects
* Average monthly working hours
* Time spent at the company
* Work accident history
* Promotion in the last 5 years
* Department
* Salary level
* Performance evaluation
* Attrition status (target variable)

##  Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing values
   * Encoded categorical variables
   * Scaled numerical features where required

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed relationships between workload, tenure, promotions, and attrition
   * Visualized trends and distributions to identify patterns

3. **Model Building**

   * Trained a machine learning classification model to predict employee attrition
   * Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics
   * Extracted feature importance to interpret key drivers of attrition

4. **Model Evaluation**

   * Accuracy
   * Precision
   * Recall
   * F1-score

##  Machine Learning Model

A supervised classification model was used to predict whether an employee will leave the company.
Feature importance analysis revealed that **workload, number of projects, tenure, and promotion history** play a significant role in employee attrition.

---

##  Key Insights

* Employees working **excessively long hours** are more likely to leave
* Employees handling **more than 4 projects** show higher attrition rates
* Lack of promotions over long tenure contributes to dissatisfaction
* Recognition and fair evaluation strongly influence employee retention

---

##  Conclusions

The analysis confirms that employee attrition at Salifort Motors is influenced by multiple factors, with **high workload and limited career growth opportunities** being the most significant. By identifying at-risk employees early, the company can take preventive actions to improve satisfaction and reduce turnover.

##  Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

* **Compensate Overworked Employees:** Introduce financial rewards or workload adjustments for employees consistently working long hours.
* **Recognize Employee Efforts:** Implement recognition programs, bonuses, and regular feedback systems.
* **Balance Promotion Rates:** Ensure fair and transparent promotion practices across all departments.
* **Establish Clear Promotion Criteria:** Clearly communicate expectations for career advancement.
* **Promote Long-Tenured Employees:** Pay special attention to employees with four or more years of service.
* **Limit Project Load:** Cap the number of concurrent projects to an optimal range of 3–4.
* **Set Realistic Deadlines:** Improve task prioritization to prevent burnout.
* **Enhance Performance Evaluation:** Conduct regular and meaningful performance reviews.
* **Conduct Exit Interviews:** Collect feedback from departing employees to address recurring issues.
